CAIRO SHELL MILESTONE 2 PREVIEW RELEASE NOTES

COPYRIGHT (C) 2007-2010 CAIRO DEVELOPMENT TEAM

KNOWN ISSUES
 - Clicking an active taskbar button does not minimize it.
 - The taskbar does not populate once Cairo is started.  You must activate any open applications
   for them to appear in the taskbar.
 - Items may disappear from the Windows taskbar when running Cairo. (Windows 7 users- You can avoid
   this by selecting the Always Combine option in the Windows Taskbar Control Panel.)
 - Not all tray icons will appear in the Cairo system tray area.
 - Newly installed or uninstalled programs may or may not show up in the AppGrabber until Cairo is
   restarted.
 - Many items are incomplete in this build.
 - Disabling and re-enabling the Desktop feature without restarting Cairo causes duplicate icons.
   Restarting Cairo fixes the problem.

REPORTING ISSUES
We have a bug reporting and feature request site set up at http://reporting.cairoshell.com
Please use it for any minor thing and every crash.  You can find a crash log file
(CairoDesktop.exe.UnhandledCrashException.Log.txt) in C:\Program Files\Cairo Shell\
as well as a screenshot (named similarly) of your desktop at the time of the crash.

PLEASE READ THE KNOWN ISSUES BEFORE SUBMITTING BUGS.  WE WILL KEEP AN UPDATED LIST OF KNOWN
ISSUES ON THE BUG REPORTING PAGE. PLEASE BE SURE TO ATTACH CRASH LOG FILES- WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT THEM.

Thank you for testing!
